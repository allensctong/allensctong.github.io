 <!-- Projects
 ====== -->
 * For the [Emory Computational Math REU](http://www.math.emory.edu/site/cmds-reuret/summer2022/), my team used PyTorch
 [code](https://github.com/lliu58b/Jacobian-free-Backprop-Implicit-Networks) to train implicit networks for image deblurring.
 We wrote a [manuscript](files/Manuscript_JFB.pdf), presented a [poster](files/REURET_Poster_Team_JFB.pdf), and created
 a [website](https://www.math.emory.edu/site/links/cmds-reuret/projects/2022-implicit/?syt=Ptcg). We are continuing numerical
 experiments with a preprint in progress.
 
 * I am a part of [DataRes](https://datares.github.io/#/), a premier data science club at UCLA. 
 I am a member of the [research](https://datares.github.io/#/research) team, where we work on graph neural networks. 
 Here is a [write-up](https://ucladatares.medium.com/deep-learning-on-graphs-integration-of-dgl-and-neo4j-dbms-for-social-analysis-321563eb900f)
 of our most recent work. I am also on the [consulting](https://datares.github.io/#/consulting) team, 
 performing data analysis and deriving insights for the UCLA Athletics teams competing in NCAA. Due to agreements with the
 UCLA Athletics Department, our work is confidential.
