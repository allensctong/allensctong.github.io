 * Advised by Prof. [Mason Porter](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~mason/), I led a course project: Temporal Multilayer Network Analysis for Marvel Superheroes. We used supracentrality methods and the Louvain community detection algorithm to discover the most important superheroes over time. Here's the [code](https://github.com/allensctong/Math168_Project), [report](https://allensctong.github.io/files/Math_168_Final_Report.pdf), and [presentation](files/Math 168 Presentation.pdf).

 * Advised by Prof. Samy Wu Fung](https://swufung.github.io/), my team used PyTorch
 [code](https://github.com/lliu58b/Jacobian-free-Backprop-Implicit-Networks) to train implicit neural networks for image deblurring.
 We wrote a [manuscript](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pbrVO5L-czau5Pfb77WPNoQpbT5CrTK7/view?usp=sharing), 
 presented a [poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Dc9T6hDFlWyob-A39Vw9cXmOqXXKgo5Z/view?usp=sharing), and created
 a [website](https://www.math.emory.edu/site/links/cmds-reuret/projects/2022-implicit/?syt=Ptcg) for the [Emory Computational Math REU](http://www.math.emory.edu/site/cmds-reuret/summer2022/). We are continuing numerical
 experiments, and a preprint is in progress.

 * I am a part of [DataRes](https://ucladatares.com/), a premier data science club at UCLA. 
 I am a member of the [research](https://ucladatares.com/research) team, where we work on graph neural networks. 
 Here is a [write-up](https://ucladatares.medium.com/deep-learning-on-graphs-integration-of-dgl-and-neo4j-dbms-for-social-analysis-321563eb900f)
 of our most recent work. I am also on the [consulting](https://ucladatares.com/consulting) team, 
 performing data analysis and deriving insights for the UCLA Athletics teams competing in NCAA. Due to agreements with the
 UCLA Athletics Department, our work is confidential.
