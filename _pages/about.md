My name is Shuaicheng (Allen) Tong. I am a senior at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) majoring in [Mathematics of Computation](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/) and minoring in [Data Science Engineering](https://www.seasoasa.ucla.edu/datasci/) and [Statistics](http://statistics.ucla.edu/). I am interested in machine learning and optimization, as well as their applications in risk management and recommender systems. I am passionate about building faster algorithms and more interpretable models using rigorous mathematical techniques.

Outside of math, I spend my free time working out, visitng museums, and watching Star Wars shows. I volunteer at the [UCLA Statistics Club](http://statistics.ucla.edu/groups/statistics-club-at-ucla/) and [Upsilon Pi Epsilon](https://upe.seas.ucla.edu/tutoring/) where I tutor mathematics, statistics, and computer science courses.
