My name is Shuaicheng (Allen) Tong. I am a rising junior at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) majoring in [Applied Mathematics](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/) and minoring in [Statistics](http://statistics.ucla.edu/). I am interested in machine learning and optimization, as
 well as their applications in supply chain management. I am passionate about building faster algorithms and more interpretable models using 
 rigorous mathematical techniques.

 Outside of math, I spend my free time working out, visitng museums, and watching Star Wars shows. I am also a volunteer at the [UCLA Statistics Club](http://statistics.ucla.edu/groups/statistics-club-at-ucla/) where I tutor mathematics and statistics courses.
