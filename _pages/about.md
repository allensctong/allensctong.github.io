My name is Shuaicheng (Allen) Tong. I am a first-year PhD student at Georgia Tech ISyE advised by Prof. [Pascal Van Hentenryck](https://sites.gatech.edu/pascal-van-hentenryck/). I completed my undergraduate studies at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) majoring in [Mathematics of Computation](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/) and minoring in [Data Science Engineering](https://www.seasoasa.ucla.edu/datasci/). 

Outside of school, I spend my free time working out, visitng museums, and watching Star Wars shows. During my undergraduate at UCLA, I volunteered at the [UCLA Statistics Club](http://statistics.ucla.edu/groups/statistics-club-at-ucla/) and [Upsilon Pi Epsilon](https://upe.seas.ucla.edu/tutoring/) where I tutored Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science courses. I also mentored underclassmen through clubs and LinkedIn. Feel free to reach out with any questions.
